# Hi, I'm Moulik Jain 👋
**Data Science & AI Professional | Machine Learning Enthusiast | Analytical Storyteller | Pennsylvania State University**

I specialize in transforming complex, multi-source data into actionable insights and predictive models. My work bridges the gap between advanced mathematical theory (Graph Theory) and real-world applications (Sports Analytics & Urban Safety) as well as between technical depth and stakeholder communication.
